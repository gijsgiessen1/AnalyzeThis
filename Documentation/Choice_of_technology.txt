This project is intended as a life analyzer application that is used in order 
to find more optimal daily routines by feeding the application data points about your activity and daily satisfaction.
The application will then give insight into what the positive and negative actions are in your life through statistics and statistical analysis.
One of the reasons for this project is to practice my (Gijs van der Giessen's) C# and .NET skills. C# will then be locked in as a technology for this project.

An important requirement for this project is that it can be used in a portable way. A person isn't always home, 
you are not going to be able to log your activities on a desktop computer at any time.

There are essentially two choices for portability: 

1.) A hybrid mobile application using Xamarin. 
2.) An easily deployable responsive web-application that fits mobile devices using ASP.NET MVC 

I will choose the second option because I need flexibility. I am not completely sure what the final features will look like exactly, except the basic requirements.
This means I want to be able to use different technologies and experiment with them. I will create an API with ASP.NET that is loosely coupled to the front-end. 
This way, I may use JavaScript statistical and visual frameworks for the visualisation of statistics or maybe even have a loosely coupled Python service on the side.
We will see where the journey leads, but it is a given that I need flexibility in technology.
